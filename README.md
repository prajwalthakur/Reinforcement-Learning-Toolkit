# Reinforcement Learning Toolkit

A curated collection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms implemented from scratch along with applications and experiments in different domains.
The goal of this repository is to provide clear, well-documented implementations that are both educational and practical.

## Features

- Implementations of classical and modern RL algorithms in Mujoco with Pytorch and JAX

- Applications to control, robotics, and simulation environments

- Modular code for easy experimentation

- Clean documentation and reproducible results
